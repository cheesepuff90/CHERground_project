# CHERground Project

The **CHERground Project** is a backend Point-of-Sale (POS) system designed for retail businesses. It provides a scalable and maintainable architecture to manage products, categories, carts, and customer data with efficiency and flexibility.

## Project Overview

Retailers often struggle with fragmented systems that cannot efficiently manage complex relationships between inventory, categories, and customer data. The CHERground Project solves this by providing a unified backend service built with TypeScript, focusing on performance, modularity, and scalability.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript  
- **ORM:** TypeORM  
- **Dependency Injection:** InversifyJS  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Architecture:** Modular repository and service layers  

## Agile Methodology

The project was developed using Agile principles, with iterative design and testing cycles. The modular structure allowed for continuous integration of new features and ensured maintainability.

## Features

- Unified backend for retail POS operations  
- CRUD support for products, categories, carts, users, and keywords  
- Efficient eager-loading queries using TypeORM  
- Dependency injection for modular and testable code  
- Expandable architecture for future business logic and entities
