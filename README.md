# CHERground Project

## Overview

The **CHERground Project** is a TypeScript-based Point-of-Sale (POS) service designed for retailers. This project provides a robust backend solution for managing products, categories, carts, images, options, keywords, and user data—empowering retailers to handle their business operations with efficiency and flexibility.

## Problem Statement

Retailers often struggle with fragmented systems that cannot efficiently manage complex relationships between inventory, categories, carts, and customer data. The CHERground Project solves this by providing a unified backend architecture that supports scalable, maintainable, and high-performance data operations for retail POS environments.

## My Role

As the primary developer and architect, I:
- Designed the data model and repository patterns for all core entities (Product, Category, Cart, Image, Status, Options, Keyword, User).
- Implemented dependency injection for modular, testable code.
- Built and tested CRUD operations for each entity.
- Focused on code organization and scalability, ensuring a foundation for future features and seamless maintenance.

## Technical Highlights

- **Eager Loading for Performance:** To address potential bottlenecks caused by frequent database lookups, the implementation leverages eager-loading via TypeORM’s join strategies. This ensures that related entities (such as product images and categories) are loaded efficiently in a single query, reducing round-trips and improving overall system performance.
- **Comprehensive Repository Interfaces:** Each core entity is managed via a well-defined repository interface, supporting clean separation of concerns and code reuse.
- **Dependency Injection:** Utilizes InversifyJS for scalable and testable architecture.
- **Full CRUD Support:** All entities support create, read, update, and delete operations.
- **Type Safety & Maintainability:** TypeScript ensures robust, reliable, and maintainable code.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **ORM:** TypeORM
- **Dependency Injection:** InversifyJS
