# CHERground Project

## Overview

The **CHERground Project** is a TypeScript-based application focused on building a comprehensive repository and management system for products, categories, carts, images, options, keywords, and user data. The project implements a robust backend structure that solves the problem of organizing, associating, and retrieving various entities in a scalable and maintainable way.

## Problem Statement

The challenge addressed in this project was to provide a flexible and well-structured backend architecture for managing e-commerce-like data entities. The system needed to handle complex relationships between products, categories, carts, images, and user information, as well as ensure efficient storage, retrieval, and updating of data. 

## My Role

As the primary developer and architect of the CHERground Project, I was responsible for:
- Designing the overall data model and interface architecture.
- Implementing repository patterns for each core entity (Product, Category, Cart, Image, Status, Options, Keyword, User).
- Integrating dependency injection for better testability and modularity.
- Building and testing CRUD operations for all entities.
- Ensuring the codebase was organized, readable, and reusable, allowing for future expansion and maintenance.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **ORM:** TypeORM (for database interactions and repository management)
- **Dependency Injection:** InversifyJS
- **Database:** (Assumed relational, e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL, via TypeORM)
- **Project Structure:** Modular repository and service layers for separation of concerns

## Features

- **Comprehensive Repository Interfaces:** Well-defined interfaces for data access related to products, categories, carts, images, users, and other entities.
- **Dependency Injection:** Clean and scalable architecture using InversifyJS.
- **CRUD Operations:** Full support for creating, reading, updating, and deleting all core data entities.
- **Expandable Design:** Easily extendable to support new entities and business logic as requirements evolve.
- **Strong Typing and Structure:** Leveraging TypeScript for maintainable and error-resistant code.
